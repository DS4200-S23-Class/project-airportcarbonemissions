        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
            Our visualization tool aims to promote greater environmental awareness 
            by tackling the carbon emissions made in the air travel industry. With the 
            industry accounting for over 2% of global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, 
            the aviation industry has been deemed to be ”not on track” to reaching net zero 
            emissions by 2050 by 
                <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/aviation">the International Energy Agency.</a> 
            However, environmental awareness has been gaining traction in many different communities, ranging 
            from students at a <a href="http://ojs.ecsdev.org/index.php/ejsd/article/view/1210">Slovakian university</a> 
            to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/09669582.2017.1372442">Chinese tourists</a>, potentially 
            due to the rise of social media sites and the greater spread of information. We 
            anticipate individuals with a growing interest in their own carbon footprint 
            taking interest in our visualization tool.
        </p>

        <p>
            The purpose of this tool is to assist users in choosing the most environmentally-friendly 
            flight for their travels from Boston or New York City and to allow users to explore how and 
            why different flights have different carbon emissions. Regarding the first purpose, we hope 
            that users will reduce their own carbon footprint by selecting the flight with the lowest 
            carbon emissions. By displaying the information and encouraging the user to be more aware of 
            their choices, we wish for the user to leave our visualization with a plane ticket out of Boston 
            and a greater drive for taking environmental issues into their own hands. As for the second 
            purpose, even if our user has no intention to travel, we want individuals to explore the data 
            we have and understand how the aviation industry has such high carbon emissions. The user should 
            leave the visualization with newfound knowledge of the aviation industry and how they can possibly 
            change their habits in the future regarding travel.
