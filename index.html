            <h2 id='header'>Motivation</h2>

            <p>
                Our visualization tool aims to promote greater environmental awareness 
                by tackling the carbon emissions made in the air travel industry. With the 
                industry accounting for over 2% of global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, 
                the aviation industry has been deemed to be not on track to reaching net zero 
                emissions by 2050 by 
                    <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/aviation">the International Energy Agency.</a> 
                However, environmental awareness has been gaining traction in many different communities, ranging 
                from students at a <a href="http://ojs.ecsdev.org/index.php/ejsd/article/view/1210">Slovakian university</a> 
                to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/09669582.2017.1372442">Chinese tourists</a>, potentially 
                due to the rise of social media sites and the greater spread of information. We 
                anticipate individuals with a growing interest in their own carbon footprint 
                taking interest in our visualization tool.
            </p>

            <p>
                The purpose of this tool is to assist users in choosing the most environmentally-friendly 
                flight for their travels from Boston or New York City and to allow users to explore how and 
                why different flights have different carbon emissions. Regarding the first purpose, we hope 
                that users will reduce their own carbon footprint by selecting the flight with the lowest 
                carbon emissions. By displaying the information and encouraging the user to be more aware of 
                their choices, we wish for the user to leave our visualization with a plane ticket out of Boston 
                and a greater drive for taking environmental issues into their own hands. As for the second 
                purpose, even if our user has no intention to travel, we want individuals to explore the data 
                we have and understand how the aviation industry has such high carbon emissions. The user should 
                leave the visualization with newfound knowledge of the aviation industry and how they can possibly 
                change their habits in the future regarding travel.
            </p>

            <p>
                To assist users in determining the most environmentally-friendly way of traveling, 
                we present our visualization tool, which aims to display two key points regarding 
                air travel:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>The flights an individual can take from Boston's Logan International Airport 
                    or John F. Kennedy International Airport to another location of interest.</li>
                <li>The carbon emission of that particular flight.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                Suppose a traveler wishes to fly from Boston to New York City. This traveler has 
                prior knowledge on global warming and how carbon dioxide contributes to that, but does 
                not have extensive knowledge on environmental science. In particular, they have a growing 
                interest in learning more about their carbon footprint and have started looking more into 
                resources that advise them on where their personal emission can be reduced; however, emissions 
                for flight data are incredibly scattered and always generalized to how the airline industry emits 
                a high amount of carbon dioxide annually. Ultimately, the traveler is seeking a tool that allows 
                them to compile data about all possible flight routes from Boston and to understand the carbon 
                emission of their choice to make better, environmentally-friendly decisions for their travel.
            </p>

            <p>
                With our visualization tool, the traveler can first select the flight and the location they 
                would like to go from a map of all possible routes from Boston. Once they have selected their 
                desired airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport, then the second paired visualization 
                will update to reflect how much carbon that particular flight produces. The paired visualization 
                will also compare the flight's carbon emission to other flights and other metrics the traveler 
                may be curious about, allowing for further exploration and gaining of knowledge regarding their 
                carbon footprint.
            </p>

            <p>
                We hope that through the exploratory aspect of our visualization tool, users will be more cautious 
                of their own footprint and make more environmentally-conscious choices when it comes to their purchases.
            </p>

            <h2 id='header'>Background</h2>

            <h3>1. Data</h3>

            <p>
            We are visualizing data of flight informations and corresponding carbon emissions per person in kilograms. The high-level task of our visualizations is to discover the data. The user is provided all of the data and is being asked to search through it for their answers.
            </p>

            <p>
            We got flight routes data through REST APIs from <a href="https://rapidapi.com/aedbx-aedbx/api/aerodatabox">AeroDataBox</a>. We extracted data of flight routes from Boston Logan International Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport
            with destination airport names and codes, latitude and longitude of the airports, and average daily flights of the routes.
            </p>

            <p>
            After that, we computed distances between destination airports and origin airports (BOS or JFK), and computed carbon emission per person and the percentage of it to the average annual carbon footprint with <a href='https://www.carbonindependent.org/22.html#:~:text=CO2%20emissions%20from%20aviation%20fuel,CO2%20per%20passenger%20per%20hour'>single flight CO2 emissions data</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/get-involved/how-to-help/carbon-footprint-calculator/#:~:text=A%20carbon%20footprint%20is%20the,is%20closer%20to%204%20tons">average carbon footprint per person data</a>.
            </p>
            <p>

            After retrieving the raw data, the resulting dataset was found to be robust and reliable, with the exception of the <q>shortName</q> column with shorter names of the airports that contains several missing values. However, after inspection, it was determined that the <q>shortName</q> column duplicated information presented in the <q>name</q> column, and was therefore deleted from the dataset. The <q>icao</q> column was also excluded since it describes the same information - airport codes - as the <q>iata</q> column, and <q>iata</q> is the more commonly used airport code format for most people.
            </p>

            <p>
            Since we only looked at flight routes of two airports (BOS and JFK) and the API calls only offer flight routes data for the current year (2023), our data is not comprehensive enough to analyze all operating flight routes in the world, or even just in the United States. However, it does provide insight for people to choose the most environmentally-friendly flight from Boston or New York City.
